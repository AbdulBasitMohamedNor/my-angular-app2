# My Angular App

This is a simple Angular workspace scaffolded manually for Angular version 20. It includes a minimal `angular.json`, a basic project structure under the `src` directory and a `package.json` with Angular 20 dependencies. You can run `npm install` to install the packages (you will need internet access) and then use the Angular CLI to build or serve the application.
